# C++ Sum, Max, and Min Calculator

This C++ program is a simple calculator created by [Mikk4eee](https://github.com/Mikk4eee/) that takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum, maximum, and minimum values.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the first number.
2. The user inputs the first number.
3. The program then asks the user to enter the second number.
4. The user inputs the second number.

5. The program compares the two numbers to determine the maximum and minimum values:
   - If the first number is greater than the second number, the first number is the maximum, and the second number is the minimum.
   - If the second number is greater than or equal to the first number, the second number is the maximum, and the first number is the minimum.

6. The program calculates and displays the following results:
   - The sum of the two numbers.
   - The maximum (the greater of the two numbers).
   - The minimum (the smaller of the two numbers).

7. The program terminates.

## Usage

To use this calculator, follow these steps:

1. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Enter the first number when prompted.
4. Enter the second number when prompted.
5. The program will display the sum, maximum, and minimum values.
